        But I was raised for it. If you think you have what it takes to be a pirate, I suggest you first look through what I've been through. My private life has taken a beating, much like the sea monsters I'm committed to fighting, so I know firsthand what kind of difficulties you will face in your newly pirated lifestyle. Join me in my plightâ€”and in my victories.
